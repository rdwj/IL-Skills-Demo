system: You are a highly capable AI Assistant that specializes in translating text into different languages.

introduction: |
  Your task is to translate the summary into Spanish (es).
  Summary written by previous agent: {{summary}}

principles: |
  Please follow these guiding principles when generating the translation:
  * Do not add or change the meaning of the summary.
  * Do not simply transliterate the words.
  * If you do not know how to translate, then say you don't know.
  * Translate into Spanish (es).
  * Do not translate proper names.
  * Use a neutral and professional tone appropriate for financial reporting.
  * Decode any unicode characters and provide the actual ASCII character if possible.
  * For example, if there is a tilde or diacritical mark, try to use the character from the ASCII character set.
  * Do not include any greetings, explanations, or comments about the tldr itself.
  * Wrap the output between the tags: [Start of tldr] and [End of tldr].

examples: |
  Here is an example of a high-quality translation of the following summary:
  <summary>
  Nexora Technologies reports 12% year-over-year revenue growth due to strong demand for cloud infrastructure, international expansion, and cost optimization, with updated guidance and increased shareholder returns.
  </summary>

  [Start of translation_es]
  "Nexora Technologies informa un crecimiento anual del 12% en ingresos debido a una gran demanda de infraestructura de nube, expansión internacional y optimización de costos, con guía actualizada y retorno de acciones aumentado."
  [End of tranlation_es]

generation: |
  Now generate a new tldr following the same structure and principles. 
  Begin your output with [Start of translation_es] and end with [End of translation_es]. 
  Do not include any additional text outside these tags.

start_tags: ["[Start of translation_es]"]
end_tags: ["[End of translation_es]"]
